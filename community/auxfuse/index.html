                Software Dev Grad since 2020 from Code Institute, and the Slack 
                community there is second to none! Currenetly working in the HSE
                as a web & filemaker Dev. One of my biggest passions is 
                building Community.

                Without the ⭕CI⭕ community, I wouldn't of made it as far as I 
                have in my career. From on-demand problem solving, to making
                some of the best friends I've ever met. 👏

                Gaming! Something about it, from the creativeness of 
                each game, to the musical score, and not to mention
                the Story elements too. I would be lying if it hasn't
                moulded me enough over the years. From gaming as a
                child, to now in my adult life.😅 My online persona
                is named Auxfuse (or Fuse). That's a story for another
                time.⚡

                I've only recently finished the Final Fantasy 7 Remake,
                and I was like an excited child hearing the Prelude in it
                for the first time. And then got chills hearing One-Winged Angel!
                <br>
                And the visuals...just look at this screenshot I took
                of Cloud & Sephiroth ⚔. Hidden behind a collapsable element
                to save anyone from Spoilers, 🙈, you've been warned.

                To counteract all the stationary moments in my day-to-day
                lifestyle from Work to Gaming, I'm an avid Olympic Weightlifter.
                No...no, I have not gone to the Olympics rather the sport is
                called Olympic Weightlifting.🏋️‍♀️ And I get to train 
                alongside my Wife, Charlene. One of the biggest primary 
                drivers in my life.🧡
                <br>
                The mental health gains and the physical prowess improvements,
                have made my stationary life that much more sustainable. Lifting
                weights doesn't just make you stronger or leaner, it allows your
                mind to decompress, your psyche to re-stabilise, and brings focus.
                <br>
                No spoiler tags this time, just me and a barbell.
