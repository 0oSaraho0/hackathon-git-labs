        I'm an student software developer that is extremely passionate about
        making society much more accessible for people with disabilities and
        neurodiversity, and hope to be able to go into a job where I can use
        both that passionate and my skills as a developer to make a difference.
        In my ideal world, neurodiversity is seen as a strength, an added bonus
        to a candidate for a job and not something that would put off an
        employer or school. It's my dream to make education and work more
        accessible for those that are ND so that they don't have to struggle as
        I have over the years.
