          Hi, I am a junior web developer 💻 - a self-motivated coding
          enthusiast. A few years ago, I dived into coding and enjoy it every
          day. In 2021 I achieved 🎉🎈 diploma in software development at Code
          Institute. At the moment I am learning 📚 Javascript language and
          NodeJS framework. In the future, I plan to learn React, later, I will
          dip into the MERN stack.
          <br />
          <br />
          I love sports like football ⚽, basketball ⛹️‍♂️ and boxing 🥊. But at
          studying time I can watch just the highlights of the match. I like to
          play FIFA 🎮🎧 (usually on weekend mornings because it is easy to beat
          opponents), also I refresh by swimming 🤿🩳 in the Irish sea 🏊‍♂️🐟🐠.
          <!-- Happy coding! -->
          <!-- 🐬🐳 -->
