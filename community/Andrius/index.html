        <p>
          Hi, I am a junior web developer - a self-motivated coding enthusiast.
          A few years ago, I dived into coding and enjoy it every day. At the
          moment I am learning Javascript language and NodeJS framework. In the
          future, I plan to learn React, later, I will dip into the MERN stack.
          I love sports like football, basketball and boxing. But at studying
          time I can watch just the highlights of the match. Happy coding! I
          like to play FIFA (usually on weekend mornings because it is easy to
          beat opponents), also I refresh by swimming in the Irish sea.
