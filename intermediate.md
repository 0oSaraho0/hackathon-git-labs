# Intermediate guide to making your first Pull Request (PR)

## Participant steps:
* This guide assumes you have read and implemented the steps from the basics.md file.

* At this point, click on the `community` directory and add a folder using the same value as the name (case sensitive) you used in the JSON object.
    For example, if the name in the JSON object was "john", then the name of the directory inside the `community` directory must be also called "john".
* Inside this named and newly created directory, please create an `index.html` file and a `style.css` file and link them together.
* Then you can create your custom html/css piece.

    Up to here, you will have successfully forked the project, cloned it, opened it, added to a dataset, created a sub-directory, and done some coding too. We do all of this so that the default project structure is left un-mutated and that you are automatically added to the root `index.html` file Community section. This is a fun way to meet new developers who you may one day be coding alongside of in a team, or asking them for help with a query in the Slack CI community.
