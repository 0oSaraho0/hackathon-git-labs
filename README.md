Ever wanted to add to an Open Source project? Maybe you wanted to learn to use Git/Github a bit more? Or even just wanted to work in a team simulated environment? This project is aimed at making a Pull Request in a structured controlled process that will allow you to learn at your own speed.

The steps outlined below will be IDE/Editor agnostic, but where possible this guide is centered towards guiding you to do particular tasks that should be global across many of the modern day IDEs/Editors.

There are two proposed streams to this project for the participant to throw their hands at, Basic and Intermediate. There is a plan in place to extend this to Advanced in the future.

--- 

The Basic stream for this project will allow the user to learn & demonstrate:
- Minimum knowledge required to submit a PR
- Forking the main repo
- Setting the upstream from their Fork back to the main repo
- Cloning the Forked project to their local development IDE/Editor
- Creating a branch from within the IDE/Editor using the Command Line Interface
- Adding to a JSON file
- Commiting work to their branch
- Creating a PR
- Completing the PR template
- Engaging with the nominated maintainers of the repo via the PR threads
- Having their PRs approved/decline or merged into the project

The Intermediate stream for this project will allow the user to learn & demonstrate:
- HTML/CSS mini-creation which will be automatically linked to from the Landing Page.

    Sometimes, it's great to showcase your work in a directory like this. You never know who you might one day be sitting beside for work ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜€
- Directory surfing and creating sub-directories
- Optional review and delve into the default files of the project where you will find Grid, Flexbox, Root variables, Fetch API, JSON etc. All of these are are done in vanilla languages, and this project is completely framework-LESS.
